In this project, I created a C++ application for Chada Tech, a software engineering company. The company wanted to upgrade its website to meet international standards by displaying both 12- and 24-hour clocks for its clients, in line with ISO 8601. The aim was to demonstrate my programming skills by developing two clocks that could display simultaneously and allow user input. I believe I excelled in designing an object-oriented programming (OOP) application that efficiently fulfilled the functional requirements. By structuring the code in an OOP manner, I ensured modularity which made it easier to maintain and extend in the future. Also, I paid close attention to security considerations, implementing secure coding practices to safeguard against potential vulnerabilities.

While my code was effective, I believe there are areas where enhancements could be made to improve efficiency and readability further. For instance, optimizing algorithms and refining error handling mechanisms could enhance the code's efficiency. Moreso, incorporating more comprehensive documentation and comments would improve readability, making it easier for other developers to understand and modify the code as needed. The most challenging aspect of the project was implementing the simultaneous display of two clocks while ensuring user input functionality. To overcome this challenge, I leveraged resources such as online tutorials, documentation, and out tutoring service. Going forward, I plan to continue expanding my support network by engaging with online communities and participating in coding forums to enhance my problem-solving skills further.The skills developed in this project, particularly in OOP design, algorithm optimization, and secure coding practices, will be highly transferable to other projects and coursework. Additionally, the emphasis on maintainability, readability, and adaptability ensures that the program remains easy to maintain, understand, and modify, facilitating its usefulness in the evolving field of software development and in the computer science field.
